# A framework for traffic camera feeds and EMS routing

</div>

[TrafficEMS](https://trafficems.com) is a framework developed for EMS routing optimization based on current traffic conditions. It provides a basis for analyzing real-time traffic conditions with ML traffic analysis using live traffic camera data as well as a GIS routing app to calculate the optimal path for EMS vehicles. This framework yields a definitive starting point for further research in this area.

# Open For Collaboration

This framework is the beginning to a large-scale traffic analysis project which could effectively route EMS vehicles along an optimal path. Please reach out [here](mailto:seanhlewis@utexas.edu) if you would like to work together to further this project.
