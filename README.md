# An informational site for professional engineers

</div>

[GlobalPE](https://global-pe.web.app) is an informational website developed for professional engineers to effectively find the licensing registration and board pages for any country. It provides a easy-to-use interactive map with updated links to the specific professional engineering websites of each country/state/province. This website serves to aid professional engineers internationally.

# Actively updating

There is no definitive list of every single country's professional engineering licensing registration/board pages, but we are creating one with this site. It is being updated with more countries' information over time. If you see a country you would like us to add immediately, please reach out [here](mailto:seanhlewis@utexas.edu).
